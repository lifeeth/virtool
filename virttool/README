Virttool: Virtual Cluster management Tool

Virttool is a tool for managing datacenters using virtualization
technologies. It is comprised of two distinct but interacting modules,
a lightweight high-avaliability monitoring daemon and a web interface
for easy management. 

It uses libvirt for node management and a database for configuration
storage, and it is build using the django framework, giving the possibility
of using many of the supported databases backends for nodes conviguration
storage backend. As it inherits libvirt functionality, it is capable of managing
whatever virtualization techonology libvirt supports, having been tested on 
production systems runing xen and on a test cluster running qemu.

When requiring high-avaliability or live migration functionality, it is
necessary to also run the virttool daemon, at it is the daemon that
coordinates virtual machine placement and resource management.
